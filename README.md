### **1. Monthly Weather Analysis:**
- I began by examining monthly weather data for Ames, Iowa, focusing on variables like precipitation, temperature (average, minimum, and maximum), and average wind speed.
- The data was cleaned and visualized to understand the trends and variations in weather conditions over the years.

### **2. Crop Yield Forecasting:**
- I analyzed the historical crop yield data for corn and soybeans.
- I used the SARIMAX model, a time series forecasting method, to predict future crop yields based on past patterns.

### **3. Combined Regressional Study (SARIMAX):**
- A regression analysis was conducted to understand the relationship between selected weather factors and crop yields.
- The results indicated only a minor relationship between weather factors and crop yields, suggesting that other factors also play a significant role.
- The SARIMAX model was then used to combine the crop yield time series with the weather data to provide a more holistic forecast.

### **4. Portfolio Simulation using Futures Data:**
- Based on a hypothetical scenario, I evaluated a portfolio of forward contracts for corn and soybeans.
- Using historical futures data, I simulated the potential prices for these crops, aiding in the hedging strategy.

### **5. VaR Calculation:**
- The Value at Risk (VaR) was calculated using historical price data to estimate potential losses in the value of the contracted crops at given confidence levels.
- This provided a quantification of price risk exposure, vital for decision-making and risk management.

### **6. Stochastic Process Incorporating Crop Yield Forecasts:**
- I used the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model to simulate possible future price paths for corn and soybeans.
- The model incorporated the results from the crop yield forecasts to adjust the initial prices and provide a more tailored price simulation.

### **7. Monte Carlo Simulation with Sensitivity Analysis:**
- A Monte Carlo simulation was built to analyze the crop purchasing scenario with probability distributions for key variables like prices, yields, and demand.
- Sensitivity analysis was conducted to understand the impact of varying key parameters, such as price volatility, drift, initial price, and contracted bushels, on the expected costs and VaR.

**Emphasis on Model Simplicity:**
The model, while comprehensive, is designed with simplicity in mind. It provides a foundational framework that can be used to understand the interactions between weather, crop yields, and commodity prices. The model is modular, meaning individual components (like the SARIMAX forecast or the GBM simulation) can be replaced or enhanced as needed.

**Towards a Robust Model:**
While the model provides valuable insights, it is just the tip of the iceberg. For a more robust analysis:

- More granular data, such as daily weather data or soil health metrics, can be incorporated.
- Advanced machine learning models can be used for forecasting, capturing non-linear relationships.
- The model can be extended to account for geopolitical factors, global trade dynamics, and other macroeconomic indicators.
- Risk management strategies can be optimized using more advanced financial instruments and hedging strategies.
- Incorporating feedback loops, where the results of the simulations inform adjustments to the model parameters, can lead to more adaptive and dynamic modeling.

In summary, the model serves as a starting point, offering a structured approach to understanding the complexities of the agriculture commodity market. With further development and refinement, it has the potential to be a powerful tool for decision-makers in the industry.
